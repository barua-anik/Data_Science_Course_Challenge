    "# Welcome to The Shortcut X Mozilla Data Science Program! \n",
    "\n",
    "This training program aimed to educate **30 participants** in Data Science fundamentals.  The content will be given by experienced Data Scientists working in __Mozilla__, __Silo.ai__, __Kodit.io__ & __Selko.io__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program runs for **11 weeks** and is a *project-based learning*, split in different models, which contains *2 hours sessions each week*, instructor-led + Lab sessions with coaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a chance to work on the real life project and by the end of the program we aim for the participants to be qualified for the work opportunities as a Junior Data Scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please complete the following challenges by **22nd September 2019 midnight** the latest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A piece of advice:** If you feel that you cannot answer all of the challenges by the deadline, DO NOT PANIC!, try to do as much as you can and submit whatever you have, then proudly patiently cross your fingers ^\\_^. The challanges are only parts of the criterias.\n",
    "\n",
    "GOOD LUCK !!!\n",
    "**Note:**It's a big plus if you can work with Jupyter Notebook, however, it's also OK if you are not familiar with it. In that case, you can write your answer in some kind of Word Document, and a separate python script for the python code challenge. Then zip them together when you submit"
